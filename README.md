# Anomaly-Detection-and-Prognostics-in-Spacecraft-Telemetry-Data
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline capable of detecting anomalies in spacecraft telemetry and providing short-term prognostics; specifically, estimating the likelihood of a fault occurring within the next N hours.
