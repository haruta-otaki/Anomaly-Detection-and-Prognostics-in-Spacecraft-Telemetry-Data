\label{sec:impacts}

As machine learning has become more ubiquitous, concern is growing in society at
large about the unintended side-effects of this technology, particularly when
deployed in domains where it has the potential to reinforce or exacerbate
existing inequities. Reflect on the particular system you have built (or similar
systems that could be built in related domains, with appropriate data) and the
potential impacts it could have on society --- are there troubling use cases? Or
upsides for society? Could the manner in which the data was collected or labeled
introduce unintended and undesirable biases in the results? While this section
can be brief (say, one to two paragraphs), you will nevertheless need to demonstrate serious engagement with these questions.
