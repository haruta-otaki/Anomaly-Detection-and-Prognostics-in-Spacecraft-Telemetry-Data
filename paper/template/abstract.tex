This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting anomalies in multivariate spacecraft telemetry data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite. We employ three anomaly detection algorithms—One-Class Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor—combined in an ensemble framework to identify both point and contextual anomalies across nine distinct telemetry channels. Our preprocessing pipeline utilises overlapping temporal windows and MiniRocket feature transformation to capture complex temporal patterns in the time series data. Through systematic threshold optimisation focused on maximising recall whilst maintaining precision, our ensemble model achieves an average recall of 0.55 and F1 score of 0.21 across all channels. The ensemble approach demonstrates superior performance compared to individual models, particularly on channels with higher anomaly rates. These results suggest that combining multiple unsupervised techniques can effectively detect spacecraft anomalies without requiring extensive labelled training data.
