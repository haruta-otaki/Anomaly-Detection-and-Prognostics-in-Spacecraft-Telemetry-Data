\subsection{AI Acknowledgment}
Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) was used for debugging, organizing code, and graphing data. It was a tool in this project, but not a crutch. It was also used to assist in \LaTeX table and graph construction. Large code portions were not generated by AI. Portions of code generated or suggested by ChatGPT are documented, and the prompt for this assignment was not fed into any form of LLM to generate our preprocessing or model files, or this paper. A .readme file for our code was assisted using AI as well. The writing in this paper is 100\% our own work and attributions and credit towards other work is cited when needed. 

% This section is optional. But if there are people you'd like to thank for their help with the project --- a person who contributed some insight, friends who volunteered to help out with data collection, etc. --- then this is the place to thank them. Keep it short!
